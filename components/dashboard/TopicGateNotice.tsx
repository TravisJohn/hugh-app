// The one place the topic gate speaks to a learner. Shared by the typed-topic
// panel and the document flow so the two cannot drift into saying different
// things about the same verdict.
//
// It renders TWO different notices, and the difference is the point:
//
//   needs_angle — Hugh is asking a question. No warning colour, no warning
//                 icon, and copy that never suggests the topic is off-limits,
//                 because it isn't. The suggestions are the answers.
//   out         — Hugh is declining, kindly, and finally. Warning treatment,
//                 no suggestions: a decline that offers a data version of the
//                 learner's subject reads as a pitch, not an answer.
//
// Rendering the first as the second is the bug this component exists to stop:
// it is what told someone typing "Generative AI" that their topic sat outside
// a data & analytics app, then offered them "Machine learning engineering
// fundamentals" as consolation.
//
// The same split decides who gets "describe it myself". Under `needs_angle`
// Hugh has asked a question, and phrasing your own answer is a legitimate one —
// chips under an imperative heading otherwise read as the only options there
// are. Under `out` Hugh has made its call, and an invitation to reword is an
// invitation to keep trying until something slips through. The topic field
// stays editable either way; what changes is whether Hugh suggests using it.
