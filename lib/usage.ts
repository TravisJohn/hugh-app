 * Since migration 049 this also adds the spend to `usage_counters`, the running
 * total the gate compares against. That write is purely additive and knows
 * nothing about what was reserved — a single gated request can log several
 * times, so the reservation is expired on a window rather than cancelled here.
 *
 * TIMING CONTRACT — awaiting this means "the write is scheduled", NOT "the row
 * exists". The write is handed to `after()` so it survives the response: on
 * Vercel the invocation can freeze the moment the response returns, and every
 * one of the ~21 call sites `void`s this promise, so an inline insert can be
 * cut off mid-flight and lost. Since 049 that is not merely an under-reported
 * gauge — `recordAgainstCounter` is what turns the gate's reservation into
 * recorded spend, so a lost write returns budget the learner really spent while
 * the provider bill still arrives. Anything needing the row to exist before it
 * continues must call `writeUsage` directly rather than awaiting this.
