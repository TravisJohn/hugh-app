/**
 * Pure helpers for building a review quiz that can only ask what the learner's
 * own notes actually support.
 *
 * The old quiz asked for exactly 5 questions regardless of how much material
 * existed. A card whose diary held four sentences still had to yield five
 * "conceptual understanding" questions, so the model filled the gap from
 * general knowledge and the learner was tested on things they never covered.
 *
 * Two rules fix that, and both live here so they are testable without an API:
 *   1. The question count is derived from how much material there is, not fixed.
 *   2. Every question must quote the note that supports it, and the quote is
 *      verified against the source text — a question that cannot be traced back
 *      is dropped rather than shown.
