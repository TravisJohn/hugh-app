/**
 * The milestone-generation call, on its own.
 *
 * Split out of `generate.ts` for the same reason `lib/tracker/priority.ts`
 * documents at its own top: `generate.ts` imports `logUsage` and `logSafeError`,
 * both of which import `server-only`, and `server-only` throws the moment a
 * plain Node process touches it. So a `tsx` script cannot import anything from
 * `generate.ts` at all.
 *
 * That matters because of what the offline replay harness needs to be true:
 * a replay has to re-run a stored generation through the SAME code as a
 * learner's build. If the script carried its own copy of the prompt call, the
 * retry and the parse, the eval would slowly drift into measuring the copy
 * rather than the product — and the drift would be invisible, because both
 * halves would keep passing their own tests.
 *
 * This module therefore has no `server-only` import anywhere in its graph, and
 * must not gain one. Usage logging and error scrubbing stay in `generate.ts`,
 * which is the server-side caller and the right place for both.

 * imported — and ES imports are hoisted, so a script that calls a `.env.local`
 * loader between its import statements has already evaluated this file before
 * that loader runs. The key is then undefined, and the SDK's complaint arrives
 * much later, once per generation, as a bare "Error" with no hint that the
 * cause was configuration. Next injects the environment before anything is
 * imported, so the app never saw this; a `tsx` script does not, so it did.
