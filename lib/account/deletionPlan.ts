/**
 * What deleting an account actually removes, and in what order.
 *
 * Part of the privacy pass. Deleting the `auth.users` row cascades all 25
 * user-owned tables (and `pending_document_extractions` via `learning_goals`),
 * but two things it does NOT reach:
 *
 *   1. Storage objects. `note-images` and `monitor-documents` are keyed
 *      `<user_id>/<parent_id>/<uuid>.<ext>`, and `storage.objects` has no
 *      foreign key to `auth.users`. Screenshots and résumés would simply stay
 *      in the bucket after the account was gone.
 *
 *   2. `track_generations`. It is `ON DELETE SET NULL` on purpose (migration
 *      048): the record that a model produced a 14-milestone track in 40s
 *      should survive de-identified. But 048's comment says "the learner's
 *      words go with the account, because goal_answers cascades" — true of the
 *      5-whys answers, and NOT true of `input_topic`, which is the topic the
 *      learner typed. That is their words too, and it has to be redacted
 *      rather than left behind.
 *
 * Pure, so the order and the redaction are unit-tested rather than implied by
 * the sequence of statements in a route (CLAUDE.md rule 7).
