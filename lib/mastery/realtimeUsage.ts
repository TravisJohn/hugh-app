// ── Realtime mastery usage accounting (pure, no I/O) ────────────────────────
//
// The mastery voice coach is the one place in Hugh where the spend does NOT
// happen on the server. `realtime-session/route.ts` mints an ephemeral client
// secret and returns it; the session then runs browser-to-OpenAI over WebRTC.
// The server hands out a credential and never hears from it again, so at the
// only moment that route runs, nothing has been spent and there is no usage
// figure to log. That is why `logUsage` was missing there — it was never a
// dropped line.
//
// This module is the other half: it folds the usage the Realtime API reports
// over the data channel into per-rate-class totals, bounds them so a tampered
// browser cannot inflate them, and turns them into `usage_logs` rows.
//
// Two events carry usage, and they are NOT the same source:
//   • `response.done` -> `response.usage`, the coach model's own tokens.
//   • `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` -> `usage`, the
//     transcription model. This is NOT included in `response.usage`.
// Two models, two rates, and so at least two rows. See `lib/pricing.ts`.
//
// What this is NOT: an invoice. It records what the API reported. Providers
// have been observed to return totals that do not reconcile exactly with the
// billing meter, and the detail breakdown is sometimes omitted entirely (see
// `split` below). Treat these rows as Hugh's best honest record of a spend it
// cannot directly observe, not as the bill.
