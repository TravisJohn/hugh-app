// ── The operation registry ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An "operation" is one attempt at something the system does on a learner's
// behalf: build a track, judge a topic, generate a quiz. `operation_events`
// records one row per attempt, answering "did it work, how long, and why not".
//
// THIS IS NOT `usage_logs` AND NOT `activity_events`. Those record spend and
// engagement respectively, at grains that cannot carry an outcome:
// `usage_logs` is priced per row, so non-spend rows corrupt the cost maths;
// `activity_events` is deduped to one row per learner per surface per day, so
// it cannot hold per-attempt anything. See PRD-observability.md §3.
//
// This registry is the single source of truth for the vocabulary. Nothing
// writes an operation id that is not here, and the admin panel iterates THIS
// rather than the table — so an orphaned id renders nowhere instead of
// corrupting a view. Adding an operation is a TypeScript change, deliberately
// not a migration, for the same reason `activity_events.feature` has no CHECK
// constraint.
//
// Pure: no React, no Supabase, no `server-only`.
