/**
 * Server-side core of the topic domain gate (see `lib/learn/topic-domain.ts`
 * for the client-facing fetch wrapper and the full domain-gate rationale).
 * Factored out so it can be called in-process — no HTTP round-trip — by any
 * server route that already has a candidate topic, not just the
 * `classify-topic` route. Used by the document-upload `extract` route
 * (PRD-course-from-document.md §6 layer 3) to gate document-derived topics
 * the same way a typed topic is gated.
 *
 * Fails OPEN on any network/parse error so a transient classifier failure
 * never blocks a legitimate learner.
 *
 * `userId` is required, not optional: this call spends tokens at every call
 * site, and an optional parameter is how a future caller forgets to bill them.
 *
 * `previousAttempts` are earlier phrasings this learner has already been asked
 * to narrow, so the judge can stop re-offering suggestions they have turned
 * down. Context for the reply only — the prompt states plainly that they carry
 * no weight in the verdict. Callers must pass topics that have been through
 * `checkTopic`, exactly as with `topic`.
