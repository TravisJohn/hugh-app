/**
 * What came back from asking Hugh a question.
 *
 * Two faults on the Ask Hugh screen share one cause, and this module is the
 * shape that fixes both.
 *
 * The first: `data.reply ?? "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again."`
 * never looked at the status. The server writes real sentences for its
 * refusals — "Monthly usage limit reached. Please contact Travis to reset or
 * upgrade." — and every one of them was thrown away and replaced with a shrug
 * that gives the learner nothing to act on. They press send again, and get the
 * same shrug.
 *
 * The second is quieter and travels further: the substitute was appended to the
 * thread **as a message from Hugh**. From there it is sent back to Claude as
 * its own prior turn on the next question, folded into the checklist rail's
 * coverage reading, written into the downloadable transcript, and — the one
 * that matters — passed to the summariser, whose output the learner saves as a
 * diary entry. Review quizzes may only quote diary entries. So a sentence Hugh
 * never said could end up as the thing a quiz asks about.
 *
 * The fix is structural rather than careful: a failure here carries no `reply`
 * at all, so there is nothing for a caller to append to the conversation even
 * by accident.
 *
 * WHY THIS DOES NOT REUSE `errors/saveOutcome`. That module reads the reply to
 * a save, and its vocabulary is right for saves and wrong here: a 403 on a save
 * means "not your row", while a 403 from this route means "your account is
 * restricted". Same number, different sentence to the person reading it.
 * Sharing the mapping would be a tidier-looking lie. Two domains, two mappings.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free, so the decision is unit-tested rather than buried
 * in a component (CLAUDE.md rule 7).
