/**
 * The pure half of the curriculum replay harness.
 *
 * `track_generations` (migration 048) records what produced each curriculum.
 * On its own that is a table nobody reads. The replay harness is what makes it
 * pay: it takes generations that really happened, re-runs them against a
 * different model at the SAME prompt, and puts the two side by side.
 *
 * The comparison the store was designed for is "same prompt, different model"
 * (decision D4). That is expressible only because the model is deliberately
 * NOT part of `prompt_fingerprint` — see `lib/claude/promptIdentity.ts`. Every
 * function here leans on that: an arm is a set of rows sharing a fingerprint
 * and differing in `model`.
 *
 * ── What lives here and what does not ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything in this module is a rule or a sum: which rows may be replayed,
 * what a replay will cost, and how two arms compare. No I/O, no clock, no
 * Anthropic client, no Supabase client. `scripts/replay-generations.ts` is the
 * shell that does those things and calls in here for every decision, per the
 * "pure logic goes in a testable module" rule in CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * ── The one measurement rule that matters ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A null `context_uptake` is NOT a zero. `lib/learn/contextUptake.ts` returns
 * null when the learner gave no content terms at all ("idk", or no answers, or
 * answers since deleted), and zero when they gave real context the model then
 * ignored. Averaging nulls as zeroes would drag every arm down by however many
 * learners skipped the questions, and would make a model look worse for
 * learners it never had anything to work with on. Nulls are excluded from the
 * mean and counted separately, everywhere, without exception.
