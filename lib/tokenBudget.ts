 * Token budget rules — what a request may reserve, and against which ceiling.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `lib/quota.ts`, which caps how many SESSIONS a free
 * learner may start. This module is about tokens and money.
 *
 * Split from `lib/usage.ts` because that module imports `server-only`, which
 * makes it unimportable from a unit test. Everything with a branch in it lives
 * here, pure and dependency-free; `lib/usage.ts` keeps the Supabase talking.
 *
 * The division of labour with Postgres (migration 049) is deliberate:
 *
 *   TypeScript (here)  decides WHAT the limit is and WHAT to reserve.
 *   Postgres (049)     applies it atomically — read, compare and increment in
 *                      one statement, so two concurrent requests cannot both
 *                      pass the same check.
 *
 * The comparison rule therefore exists in exactly one place. Postgres is handed
 * the numbers; it does not know the plan rules, and this module does no
 * arithmetic on shared state.
