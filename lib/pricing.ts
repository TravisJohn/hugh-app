/**
 * Per-model token pricing.
 *
 * `usage_logs` records the model that served each call (migration 036), so cost
 * is computed per log row and summed — never by applying one blended rate to an
 * aggregate. Hugh mixes Sonnet, Haiku and several OpenAI models whose rates
 * differ by up to 67x — gpt-4o-mini text input at 0.15 against realtime audio
 * input at 10.00 — so aggregate-then-price overstates the cheap routes badly.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it can be unit-tested without Supabase.
