// ── The feature registry ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One entry per surface in Hugh: what a learner can reach, which API routes it
// owns, where its code lives, which tables it touches, and — the part nothing
// else in the codebase knows — which rows in each of the three telemetry stores
// belong to it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Hugh records three different things in three different
// tables, deliberately, and each speaks its own vocabulary:
//
//   usage_logs.feature        route-level    "learn/chat", "tracker/verify"
//   activity_events.feature   surface-level  "ask", "notes"
//   operation_events.operation operation-level "track.build", "quiz.generate"
//
// Those vocabularies must stay different — that is settled in CLAUDE.md and is
// correct. But because nothing maps between them, no view can put spend,
// engagement and outcome for one feature side by side. Every figure on /admin
// today is grouped by user or by model; not one is grouped by feature.
//
// This file is the join key. It is the reason /admin/features can exist.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a second copy of `lib/monitor/features.ts`. That
// module owns the ten learner-facing calendars in Monitor's Usage view, along
// with their display order and seed caveats. This registry is a superset — it
// also carries internal surfaces with no calendar (admin, margin, the app
// shell) — and carries no display concerns at all. `features.test.ts` asserts
// the overlap between the two agrees, so neither can drift from the other.
//
// ADDING A FEATURE is a TypeScript change, deliberately not a migration — the
// same stance `lib/observability/operations.ts` takes, for the same reason: an
// entry that is wrong renders nowhere, rather than corrupting a view.
//
// Pure: no React, no Supabase, no `server-only`.
