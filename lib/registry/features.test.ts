// ── The drift guard and the boundary guard ──────────────────────────────────
//
// A registry that can go stale is just another markdown file. This one cannot,
// because these tests read the filesystem and fail the build when the registry
// and the code disagree.
//
// Two jobs, deliberately in one file because they share the same scan:
//
//   DRIFT    — everything in the repo is owned by exactly one feature, and
//              every telemetry vocabulary is fully claimed. A new route, a new
//              folder, or a new logUsage string that nobody declared is a
//              failed build with a message naming what to add.
//
//   BOUNDARY — features may import infrastructure, and may import each other
//              ONLY along edges written down with a reason. This is the single
//              real benefit of splitting Hugh into separate repositories,
//              delivered without any of the deployment machinery.
//
// Failure messages name the offending path and say what to do, because the
// person who trips these is not necessarily the person who wrote them.
