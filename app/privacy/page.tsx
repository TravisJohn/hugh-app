// Route gating in this app lives in the pages themselves, so omitting the check
// is all that is required (proxy.ts only refreshes sessions).
//
// Standard headings, Hugh-specific facts. A boilerplate template would claim
// things untrue here (advertising, analytics partners, data sharing) and omit
// the things that matter and are genuinely unusual — that an uploaded
// screenshot is read by a vision model, and that voice is transcribed by
// Google via the browser.
//
// Rule 4 exception: this scrolls, for the same reason the landing page does.
// It is a document, not a teaching surface.

          Hugh is a learning tool for data and analytics. This page describes what it
          stores about you, who else sees it, how long it is kept, and how to remove
          it. It is written to be accurate rather than reassuring — where something
          leaves our systems, it says so.

            your answers to the questions Hugh asks before building a track, your learning

          <p><strong className="text-slate-300">What you upload.</strong> If those features are
            switched on for your account: screenshots you add to Notes, and documents such as
            CVs or job descriptions. They are off by default and are not available to most

            Hugh is built on AI models it does not run itself. To answer you, parts of
            what you write are sent to the companies below. We do not sell your data,
            we do not share it for advertising, and Hugh runs no third-party analytics
            or advertising trackers.

            <li><strong className="text-slate-300">Anthropic (Claude)</strong> — receives your
              topic, your answers, diary entries and tutor messages, to generate and teach
              your track. Anthropic states it does not use commercial API data to train its
              models by default.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-slate-300">OpenAI</strong> — receives screenshots you
              upload to Notes, so a vision model can read and comment on them, and some text
              for summarising. OpenAI states that API data is not used to train its models
              unless you opt in, and that it may retain it for up to 30 days for abuse
              monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-slate-300">ElevenLabs</strong> — receives the text Hugh
              speaks aloud, to turn it into audio. It receives text, not your voice.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-slate-300">Google</strong> — when you speak to Hugh in the
              Prove-it exercise, transcription uses your browser&apos;s built-in speech
              recognition. In Chrome that is not processed on your device: your browser sends
              the audio to Google to be transcribed. Hugh receives only the text back.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-slate-300">Supabase and Vercel</strong> — host the database
              and the application itself, so your data is stored on their infrastructure.</li>
