//
// Privacy pass (migration 050): this surface accepts arbitrary uploaded images
// and sends every one to OpenAI's vision model to be read, which makes it the
// least bounded personal-data path in the product. It is off by default. The
// database enforces that in RLS and the /api/notes/* routes enforce it again
// (they use the service-role client, which bypasses RLS); this check only
// decides whether it is worth drawing the workspace at all.
