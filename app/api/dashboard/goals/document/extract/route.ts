 * Extraction has no user context of its own, so it hands the token counts back

 * accumulate across retries — a discarded attempt still costs money.
 *
 * It used to accumulate them and then `throw`, which lost every one of them on
 * the only path where the total mattered: two Sonnet calls carrying a whole
 * document, billed and unrecorded. Returning an outcome instead of throwing is
 * what makes the counts survive the failure — see lib/claude/attemptWithUsage,
 * where `report` is deliberately called before the parse that can throw.
