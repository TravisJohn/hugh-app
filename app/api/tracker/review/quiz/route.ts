${entriesText}

Write ${target} multiple-choice question${target === 1 ? "" : "s"} checking whether the learner understood what their own notes say.

Hard rules:
- Draw ONLY on the notes above. If a fact is not in the notes it must not appear in a question, an option, or an explanation — not even standard textbook knowledge of the subject.
- "source" must be a phrase or sentence copied VERBATIM from the notes that makes the correct answer true. It is checked against the notes automatically; a question whose source is not found there is discarded.
- Test understanding of what the notes claim, not recall of their exact wording.
- Exactly 4 options, exactly one correct.
- Give a 1-2 sentence explanation of why the correct answer is right, drawn from the notes.
- If the notes genuinely support fewer than ${target} questions, return fewer. Returning fewer is correct; inventing material is not.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array — no markdown, no commentary:
[
  {
    "question": "...",
    "options": ["Option text A", "Option text B", "Option text C", "Option text D"],
    "correctIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "...",
    "source": "verbatim phrase from the notes"
