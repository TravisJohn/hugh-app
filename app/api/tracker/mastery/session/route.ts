Score the learner from 1 to 10 across these dimensions:
- Accuracy: are their explanations factually correct relative to their own notes?
- Clarity: are they explained well and easy to follow?
- Confidence: do they sound fluent and self-assured?
- Completeness: did they cover the key aspects of the topic?

A score of 7 or higher means they have demonstrated sufficient mastery.

Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown fences:
{
  "score": <integer 1-10>,
  "feedback": "<2-3 sentences: start with what was strong, then note what could be sharper>",
  "passed": <true if score >= 7>
