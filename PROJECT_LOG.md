# Hugh — Project Log

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅
- Installed all dependencies (Supabase SSR, ElevenLabs, Anthropic, server-only, etc.)
- Created `lib/supabase/client.ts` and `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Created `lib/supabase/auth-helper.ts` with dev-bypass for API testing
- Created `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (run manually in Supabase Dashboard)
- Renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` per Next.js 16 convention
- Created login/signup pages and root layout

## Phase 2 — Types, Personas, Room Selection ✅
- `types/index.ts` — InterviewState, Room, Persona, Session, Question, Answer
- `lib/personas.ts` — server-only persona config (Marcus, Sarah, James)
- `app/page.tsx` — room selection landing page
- `app/interview/[room]/page.tsx` — interview room shell (Server Component)
- `components/interview/PersonaBar.tsx` and `BreakButton.tsx`
- `app/actions/session.ts` — `createSession` and `pauseSession` Server Actions

## Phase 3a — API Routes ✅
All routes under `app/api/interview/`:
- `generate-question/` — intro (hardcoded pool) + domain (Claude-generated)
- `tts/` — ElevenLabs via `personaId` lookup (voiceId stays server-only)
- `check-similarity/` — Claude-judged alignment, threshold ≥ 90%
- `generate-feedback/` — context-aware 2–3 sentence feedback via Claude
All 5 integration tests passing (`scripts/test-api.ts`).

## Phase 3b — Hooks ✅
- `hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts` — fetch TTS audio, Web Audio API, AnalyserNode waveform data via ref (no 60fps re-renders), play-ID counter prevents stale onEnded fires after manual stop
- `hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts` — Web Speech API wrapper, continuous mode with auto-restart on silence, interim + final transcript merging
- `hooks/useInterview.ts` — full state machine (IDLE → PLAYING_QUESTION → READY → RECORDING → REVIEWING → SUBMITTING → FEEDBACK → BREAK), stateRef mirrors state to avoid stale closures in callbacks
- `types/speech.d.ts` — manual Web Speech API type declarations (SpeechRecognition, SpeechRecognitionEvent, SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent) absent from TypeScript DOM lib
- `types/index.ts` extended with `ClientPersona` (Omit<Persona, 'voiceId'>) for safe client-side persona passing
Zero TypeScript errors confirmed (`npx tsc --noEmit`).

**Missed from log — Coaching modes** (built in Phase 3b, not logged at the time):
- `CoachingMode` type (`'active' | 'passive'`) added to `types/index.ts`
- **Active mode** — full feedback loop after each answer: similarity check → feedback generation → `FEEDBACK` state → TTS playback → Next/Break buttons
- **Passive mode** — silent path: similarity check and feedback are generated and persisted to Supabase but never surfaced to the user; hook skips `FEEDBACK` state entirely and jumps straight to the next `PLAYING_QUESTION`; session is auto-completed via `completeSession()` if ≥ 5 answers given, otherwise `pauseSessionWithNotice()`
- `coachingModeRef` (not state) holds the mode inside `useInterview` so the async `submitAnswer` callback always reads the current value without stale-closure issues
- `InterviewRoom` receives `coachingMode` as a prop from the Server Component page; `PersonaBar` displays a badge indicating the active mode

## Key Design Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `waveformDataRef` not state | `MutableRefObject<Uint8Array>` | 60fps state updates cause entire InterviewRoom to re-render; WaveformPlayer reads the ref in its own RAF loop |
| Play ID counter | `useRef<number>` | Prevents `onended` of a stopped source from calling `onEnded()` after a new play starts |
| `stateRef` alongside `state` | `useRef` mirrors `useState` | Callbacks with empty dep arrays see current state without stale closure bugs |
| `ClientPersona` type | `Omit<Persona, 'voiceId'>` | ElevenLabs voice IDs are resolved server-side via `personaId`; never sent to client |
| Model | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` returned 404; corrected after health check |

## Phase 4 — Interview Room UI ✅
**8 new components + InterviewRoom orchestrator wired to useInterview:**

- `WaveformPlayer` — canvas RAF loop reading waveformDataRef, 48 bars, #38BDF8, ResizeObserver for responsive width, DPR-aware rendering
- `QuestionCard` — Lora serif italic, large/small size with CSS transitions, curly quotes
- `BestAnswerPanel` — "Suggested Approach" label, max-h-36 internal scroll for long answers
- `MicButton` — 96px circular sky-400 button, animate-ping glow ring, mic SVG icon
- `LiveTranscript` — real-time transcript with auto-scroll, pulsing red recording badge
- `TranscriptEditor` — auto-resize textarea (max 288px), Submit Answer + Re-record actions
- `FeedbackCard` — WaveformPlayer while playing, first-sentence bold, Next/Break buttons appear after isPlaying=false
- `InterviewRoom` — Client Component orchestrator, Strict Mode guard on startSession, state-driven content switching

**Other changes:**
- `PersonaBar` — updated to ClientPersona (no voiceId), live questionIndex prop
- `app/interview/[room]/page.tsx` — constructs ClientPersona (strips voiceId), renders InterviewRoom
- `hooks/useInterview.ts` — added reRecord() handler (REVIEWING → READY)
- `app/layout.tsx` + `globals.css` — added Lora serif font via next/font/google, --font-serif CSS var
- `types/speech.d.ts` — Web Speech API types (SpeechRecognition, events, errors)
- `types/index.ts` — ClientPersona = Omit<Persona, 'voiceId'>

**Verification:** TypeScript zero errors, HTTP 200 on /login, HTTP 307 (compile OK) on all 3 interview rooms

## Phase 5 — UX Cohesion (PRD-v3) ✅

**Three-zone layout implemented across all interview states:**

- `components/interview/QuestionZone.tsx` (new) — question text anchored here, font size transitions smoothly with `transition-all duration-300` (large in PLAYING/READY, small otherwise), never remounts
- `components/interview/ActionZone.tsx` (new) — fixed `h-28` bottom strip, all buttons live here exclusively
- `components/interview/SubmittingState.tsx` (new) — two `animate-pulse` skeleton bars + caption, replaces faint text
- `components/interview/InterviewRoom.tsx` — full restructure: `max-w-3xl mx-auto` wrapper, `key={state}` on content zone for `animate-fadeIn`, all buttons moved out of content zone into ActionZone
- `components/interview/FeedbackCard.tsx` — buttons removed (now in ActionZone), clean waveform + text display only
- `components/interview/TranscriptEditor.tsx` — buttons removed, `onChange` prop added; InterviewRoom mirrors `reviewText` state to pass to `submitAnswer`
- `app/globals.css` — `@keyframes fadeIn` + `.animate-fadeIn` class added
- `lib/claude/prompts.ts` — `introQuestionBestAnswerPrompt` now generates instructional prose (structure/approach guidance) instead of `[Job Title]` placeholder templates
- Recording indicator: pulsing red dot (`animate-ping`) + "Recording…" text
- WaveformPlayer: already 80px in both PLAYING_QUESTION and FEEDBACK — no change needed

**Verification:** Zero TypeScript errors, clean production build, all 11 routes compiled.

## Phase 6 — Bug Fixes (Live Testing) ✅

Six bugs identified from live testing, all resolved:

| # | Bug | Fix |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 | RECORDING state showed both a standalone "Recording…" indicator (content zone) and "Stop Recording" button (ActionZone) simultaneously | Replaced inline indicator with `<LiveTranscript>` component — live transcript now fills the content zone; ActionZone Stop button is the sole recording control |
| 2 | Claude API feedback returned `**bold**` raw markdown asterisks | Added `renderBold()` in `FeedbackCard.tsx` — splits on `**...**` regex and wraps matches in `<strong>` tags; no new dependencies |
| 3–5 | Long questions pushed IdealAnswerPanel off-screen; IdealAnswerPanel overlapped ActionZone mic button; page-level and panel-level scrollbars both visible | `QuestionZone`: added `max-h-[35vh] overflow-y-auto` cap. Middle wrapper and content zone wrapper: added `overflow-hidden`. READY/RECORDING/REVIEWING/PLAYING/IDLE/BREAK content divs: added `min-h-0` for correct flex shrink. ActionZone stays anchored at bottom; page itself never scrolls |
| 6 | Default browser scrollbar visible on dark backgrounds | Added global `*` custom scrollbar CSS in `globals.css`: 6px width, transparent track, `#334155` thumb, `#475569` hover thumb, using both `::-webkit-scrollbar` (Webkit) and `scrollbar-width/color` (Firefox) |

Zero TypeScript errors confirmed post-fix.

---

## Phase 7 — Session Setup (Custom Topics, Job Ad, Skip Intro) ✅

Replaced the three-card room selector with a unified session setup form. Three features shipped together as they share the same entry point.

### Feature 1 — Custom topic selection
- `types/index.ts` — added `PresetRoom = 'data_engineering' | 'data_science' | 'ml_engineering'`, `Room = PresetRoom | 'custom'`, `isPresetRoom()` guard
- `supabase/migrations/003_session_setup_fields.sql` — widened `sessions_room_check` constraint to include `'custom'`; added `topic TEXT`, `job_description TEXT`, `skip_intro BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` columns
- `components/landing/SessionSetupForm.tsx` (new) — three preset chips + free-text input; clicking a chip pre-fills the field; editing the field deselects all chips; room slug is `selectedRoom ?? 'custom'`; topic text only stored for custom sessions (presets fall back to `ROOM_CONTEXT` server-side)
- `lib/claude/prompts.ts` — `ROOM_CONTEXT` typed as `Record<PresetRoom, string>` and exported; `questionGenerationPrompt` signature changed to `(topicContext: string, previousQuestions: string[], jobDescription?: string)`
- `app/api/interview/generate-question/route.ts` — computes `topicContext = isPresetRoom(room) ? ROOM_CONTEXT[room] : topic`; accepts `topic?` and `jobDescription?` in request body

### Feature 2 — Job ad input
- `SessionSetupForm` — collapsible "Paste a job description (optional)" section; textarea expands on toggle; job ad trimmed before sending
- `app/actions/session.ts` — `createSession` accepts `jobDescription?`; stored as `job_description` on session
- `generate-question` route — `jobDescription` passed to `questionGenerationPrompt` as third arg; appended to Claude prompt: tailors question to specific stack, seniority, responsibilities (capped at 1 500 chars to limit token use)
- `app/api/interview/generate-hint/route.ts` — same `topicContext` resolution pattern for `hintGenerationPrompt`; `hintGenerationPrompt` updated to accept `topicContext: string` directly

### Feature 3 — Skip intro toggle
- `SessionSetupForm` — pill toggle switch (off by default); "Jump straight to domain questions" sub-label
- `app/actions/session.ts` — `skipIntro?` stored as `skip_intro` on session
- `hooks/useInterview.ts` — `startSession` accepts `topic?`, `jobDescription?`, `skipIntro?`; `topicRef` + `jobDescriptionRef` added (same stale-closure pattern as `coachingModeRef`); when `skipIntro = true`, first question is `questionType = 'domain'`, `questionIndex = 2` — no state machine changes, existing transitions unchanged; all `apiFetchQuestion` calls thread `topic` and `jobDescription` from refs

### Other changes
- `app/page.tsx` — imports `SessionSetupForm` (replaces `RoomGrid`)
- `app/interview/[room]/page.tsx` — reads `topic`, `job_description`, `skip_intro` from session; passes to `InterviewRoom`
- `components/interview/InterviewRoom.tsx` — `topic?`, `jobDescription?`, `skipIntro?` props; passed to `startSession` and `PersonaBar`
- `components/interview/PersonaBar.tsx` — `topic?` prop; `ROOM_LABELS` gains `custom: 'Custom'` key; custom sessions display their topic text instead of "Custom"
- `components/interview/SessionSummary.tsx` — same `ROOM_LABELS` fix + `topic?` prop for summary header
- `lib/claude/prompts.ts` — `sessionAssessmentPrompt` uses `isPresetRoom` guard and accepts optional `topic?`; `hintGenerationPrompt` accepts `topicContext: string`

**Verification:** Zero TypeScript errors confirmed (`npx tsc --noEmit`).

---

## Phase 8 — Landing Page UI Fixes ✅

Five visual fixes on the session setup page; interview room layout untouched.

| # | Fix | Change |
|---|-----|--------|
| 1 | Toggle knob overlapping "S" in "Skip intro question" | `gap-3 → gap-4` between toggle and label text; added `shrink-0` to button so it can't compress; sub-label indent updated from `pl-14` to `pl-[60px]` (`44px button + 16px gap`) |
| 2 | No breathing room between headline and Topic section | Main `gap-8 → gap-10` (32px → 40px) between h1 and form |
| 3 | CTA button cut off on laptop screens | Outer wrapper `h-screen overflow-hidden → min-h-screen` (no overflow clip); main drops `min-h-0`, gains `py-10` padding; page scrolls naturally when content exceeds viewport |
| 4 | No user avatar in header | Added 32px circular `bg-slate-700` avatar left of email showing uppercased first character of the email local-part |
| 5 | Plain "Hugh" text in nav | `import Image from "next/image"`; replaced text span with `<Image src="/hugh-logo.png" height={32} width={120} className="h-8 w-auto" priority />` |

Files changed: `app/page.tsx`, `components/landing/SessionSetupForm.tsx`.  
Zero TypeScript errors confirmed.

---

## Phase 9 — JD-only Session Validation ✅

Allow sessions to start with a job description alone — no explicit topic required.

**Validation change (`SessionSetupForm.tsx`):**
- `canSubmit` now passes when any of: preset room selected, topic text present, or job ad present
- Previous rule required topic or preset; new rule: topic **OR** job description **OR** preset

**Prompt change (`lib/claude/prompts.ts`):**
- `questionGenerationPrompt` signature changed from `topicContext: string` → `topicContext: string | null`
- When `null`, the role intro becomes: *"You are a senior interviewer. Infer the interview domain, required stack, and seniority level entirely from the job description below."* — Claude derives domain context from the JD rather than a named topic

**Route change (`app/api/interview/generate-question/route.ts`):**
- `topicContext` resolution: custom room + no topic + JD present → `null` (triggers JD-infer path)
- custom room + no topic + no JD → `"general data and ML engineering"` (unchanged fallback)
- Preset rooms always use `ROOM_CONTEXT[room]` regardless of JD (unchanged)

Zero TypeScript errors confirmed.

---

## Phase 10 — Interviewer Audio Toggle ✅

Allow users to disable ElevenLabs TTS so questions and feedback are text-only. Microphone and Web Speech API remain active regardless of this setting.

### What the toggle controls
**On**: interviewer speaks questions and feedback aloud via ElevenLabs TTS (unchanged behaviour).  
**Off**: TTS skipped entirely; question text is shown immediately, feedback text is shown immediately. Mic and speech recognition are unaffected — recording flow is identical in both modes.

### Setup page (`components/landing/SessionSetupForm.tsx`)
- Added `voiceEnabled` state (default `true`)
- "Interviewer audio" toggle added below skip intro toggle; sub-label "Questions and feedback spoken aloud"; inline note "Adds 1–3s per question for audio generation" shown when ON
- `voiceEnabled` passed as 6th argument to `createSession`

### DB (`supabase/migrations/004_voice_enabled.sql`)
- `voice_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true` added to `sessions` — existing sessions keep voice ON

### Types (`types/index.ts`)
- `voice_enabled: boolean` added to `Session` interface

### Server Action (`app/actions/session.ts`)
- `voiceEnabled?` parameter added, stored as `voice_enabled` in DB

### Interview page (`app/interview/[room]/page.tsx`)
- Reads `voice_enabled` from session (defaults `true` if null), passes as `voiceEnabled` prop to `InterviewRoom`

### Hook (`hooks/useInterview.ts`)
- `voiceEnabledRef = useRef(true)` — same stale-closure pattern as `coachingModeRef`
- `startSession` accepts `voiceEnabled?`, sets ref on session start
- When `voiceEnabledRef.current === false`:
  - `startSession`: skips `play()`, transitions directly `→ READY`
  - `submitAnswer` passive path: skips `play()`, transitions `→ READY`
  - `submitAnswer` active path: skips `play()`, enters `FEEDBACK` with `isPlaying=false` (buttons appear immediately)
  - `nextQuestion`: skips `play()`, transitions directly `→ READY`
- RECORDING state and `submitAnswer` guard are unchanged — mic is always the input

### Interview room (`components/interview/InterviewRoom.tsx`)
- `voiceEnabled?` prop added; `isVoice = voiceEnabled ?? true` used throughout
- `PLAYING_QUESTION` content: waveform (voice on) or "Loading question…" pulse (voice off); state is skipped entirely in the hook when voice off so this is a fallback only
- `FEEDBACK` content: FeedbackCard with waveform (voice on) or plain text-only div (voice off)
- `FEEDBACK` ActionZone: unchanged — `isPlaying=false` from the start when voice off, buttons appear immediately
- `RECORDING` content and ActionZone: identical in both modes (MicButton, LiveTranscript, Stop Recording)

Zero TypeScript errors confirmed.

## Phase 11 — Public Landing Page + Route Split ✅

Separated the public marketing page from the authenticated session setup page.

### Route changes
| Route | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Session setup form (required auth redirect) | Public marketing landing page |
| `/home` | Did not exist | Session setup form (requires auth) |

### New files
- `app/home/page.tsx` — authenticated session setup page moved here; redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced entirely with public marketing landing page (Server Component); redirects authenticated users to `/home`

### Redirects updated
- `app/actions/session.ts` — `pauseSession` and `pauseSessionWithNotice` redirect to `/home` and `/home?notice=min5`
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — post-login redirect: `/` → `/home`
- `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` — email confirmation redirect and post-signup redirect: `/` → `/home`
- `app/interview/[room]/page.tsx` — guard redirects: `/` → `/home`

### Landing page sections
- **Nav**: amber GraduationCap icon + "Hugh" serif + "skill prep app" pill + Sign in link
- **Hero**: 88px amber avatar, serif headline, subtext, primary ("Start practicing free") + secondary ("Sign in") buttons, attribution line
- **The Platform**: 3 cards — Interview prep (sky border, Live badge), Progress tracker (SOON, opacity-60), Focused learning (SOON, opacity-60)
- **How It Works**: 4 steps in `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4`; Step 1 has `border-t-2 border-sky-500`, rest have `border-t border-slate-700`
- **Bottom CTA**: serif "Ready to face it?", "Enter a room" button, footer text

Icons: `GraduationCap`, `Mic`, `TrendingUp`, `Lightbulb` (lucide-react).  
Zero TypeScript errors confirmed (`npx tsc --noEmit`).

## Phase 6 — Deploy

### Environment Variables (Vercel)
Add each of these in Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

**Anthropic**
- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**ElevenLabs**
- [ ] `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- [ ] `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID_1` (Marcus)
- [ ] `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID_2` (Sarah)
- [ ] `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID_3` (James)

**Supabase**
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Supabase Production
Run both migrations in the Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor (in order):
- [ ] `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` — creates `sessions`, `questions`, `answers` tables + RLS policies
- [ ] `supabase/migrations/002_phase2_schema.sql` — adds `coaching_mode` to `sessions`, `hint` to `questions`
- [ ] Confirm RLS is enabled on all three tables in the Supabase Table Editor

### API Route Hardening
Gaps found in source — address before public launch:
- [ ] No rate limiting on any of the 6 API routes (`generate-question`, `tts`, `check-similarity`, `generate-feedback`, `generate-hint`, `generate-session-assessment`) — add Vercel's built-in rate limiting or an edge middleware solution
- [x] `tts` route: `text` field capped at 2 000 characters — returns 400 if exceeded (guards ElevenLabs cost)
- [ ] `check-similarity` and `generate-feedback` routes: `transcript` field has no length cap — large transcripts inflate Claude token usage; add a max length guard
- [ ] `next.config.ts` is empty — add security headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`) via the `headers()` export

### Smoke Tests
Run these manually after deploying to Vercel production:
- [ ] Auth flow: sign up with a new email → confirm email → log in → land on room selection page → sign out
- [ ] Full interview loop: select a room → confirm persona assigned and question plays via TTS → record a spoken answer → review and submit transcript → receive spoken feedback → click Next Question → session saves correctly on Take a Break

## Phase 12 — Product Pivot: Hugh Learning Platform ✅

Product direction changed from interview coaching to an AI-powered learning platform. Interview features kept but decommissioned from the main navigation. New core loop: user sets a learning goal → refinement Q&A → auto-generated Kanban track → Ask Hugh chat → session diary.

### Product areas built

**Dashboard (`/home`)**
- Refinement Q&A flow ("5 whys" / onion method) — up to 5 Claude-generated questions to deepen a stated goal; in-place state machine (`idle → refining → waiting → done`), no page transitions
- Waiting state: animated brain + 4 cycling stage labels + rotating expert tips (topic-specific, from Claude)
- Goal saved with AI-refined topic name (`refineTopicPrompt`); "Let's Discuss" button triggers the flow
- `app/api/dashboard/refine/route.ts` — POST `{ topic, answers[] }` → `{ question, done }`
- `app/api/dashboard/goals/route.ts` — accepts `answers[]`, calls Claude for refined topic + tips, inserts goal, auto-generates linked track

**Tracker (`/tracker`, `/tracker/[trackId]`)**
- Kanban board: Backlog → Learn → Review → Done columns, drag-and-drop via `@dnd-kit/core`
- Milestone cards with diary entry count badge; drag updates column in DB via PATCH
- `MilestoneDrawer` — slides in on card click: summary, "Ask Hugh →" CTA, full learning diary (entries with title + timestamp)
- `lib/tracker/generate.ts` — shared `generateTrack()` helper called by both manual creation and goal finalization
- `supabase/migrations/009_track_goal_link.sql` — added `goal_id FK` on `tracks` linking goals to their auto-generated track

**Study sub-pages (`/study/[goalId]`)**
- Goal landing: three cards — Track (green, "Start here" badge), Ask (violet), Converse (locked, "Hugh needs more learning data")
- Shared `StudyTabs` component for tab navigation (URL-based active state)
- `/study/[goalId]/track` — queries track by `goal_id`, shows Kanban directly (no landing page)
- `/study/[goalId]/ask` — full ChatWindow with summarise and milestone focus strip (`?milestoneId=&milestone=`)

**Ask Hugh chat (`/learn`, `/api/learn/chat`, `/api/learn/summarize`, `/api/learn/save-summary`)**
- `focusedLearningSystemPrompt` — JSON-structured response `{ reply, isOffTopic }`, off-topic replies redirect politely
- `ChatBubble` — markdown rendering via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`
- Off-track notice banner with dismiss
- Summarise session: side panel with narrative story (3–4 sentences) + highlighted key takeaway

**Landing page (`/`)**
- `FeatureCards` client component: Track (green), Ask (violet), Converse (locked/sky) — clicking reveals Sign in / Create account buttons inline
- Converse: "coming soon" inline notice; no auth buttons shown

### Key technical decisions
| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic welcome stripped from API calls | Filter index-0 assistant message before sending to Claude | Prevents format drift — Claude sees a non-JSON assistant turn and stops honouring the JSON system prompt on longer threads |
| Auto-generate track during goal finalization | `generateTrack()` called inside the goals POST while user sees waiting state | No separate action needed; track is ready when user first opens Study page |
| `milestoneId` in Ask Hugh URL | `?milestoneId=id&milestone=title` | ID is needed for the save-summary API; title is for the display focus strip |
| Session summary format | Narrative story + single takeaway (not bullet lists) | More useful as a diary record; the story is saveable as a readable learning entry |

### Migrations required (run in order)
- `009_track_goal_link.sql` — `goal_id` FK on `tracks`
- `010_milestone_entry_title.sql` — `title TEXT` column on `milestone_entries`

Zero TypeScript errors confirmed after each milestone.

---

## Phase 13 — UX Polish Pass ✅

Fixes and improvements from live testing:

| Item | Change |
|---|---|
| Chat errors on 4th+ message | Stripped synthetic welcome from API payload in `ChatWindow`; added plain-text fallback in `/api/learn/chat` when Claude drifts from JSON format |
| Raw `**markdown**` in chat bubbles | `ChatBubble` now uses `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` |
| Ask Hugh drawer cramped + raw markdown | Removed inline chat tab entirely; replaced with a violet "Ask Hugh about this →" card navigating to the full Ask page |
| Milestone context lost in Ask page | URL carries `?milestoneId=` (for save API) and `?milestone=` (for focus strip display); focus strip shows a "Clear focus ×" link |
| Save to Tracker had no navigation | After save, `SummaryPanel` navigates to `/study/[goalId]/track?pulse=[milestoneId]` after 800ms |
| No visual feedback on saved card | `KanbanBoard` accepts `pulseId`; matching card glows violet (bright border + shadow) for 5 seconds then fades via `useEffect` timeout |
| Diary entries lacked identity | `milestone_entries.title` column added; Ask Hugh sessions auto-titled "Ask Hugh — DD Mon YYYY, HH:MM"; title shown in violet above timestamp in drawer |
| Sign-up page "Hugh" missing period | Fixed to "Hugh." in both the form header and confirmation screen |
| Card reorder on Study landing | Track (highlighted, "Start here") → Ask → Converse (locked) |
| Landing page cards outdated | Updated to Track / Ask / Converse naming with click-to-reveal auth buttons |
| Active Kanban card glow | `isActive` state applies `ring-1 ring-violet-500/30 shadow-[0_0_18px_...]` border; `isPulsing` (post-save) applies brighter `ring-2 ring-violet-400/40` glow |

Zero TypeScript errors confirmed.

> **Log gap note:** Phases for the admin system, user approval/usage gate, premium gate, milestone review (quiz) and milestone mastery (voice) shipped between Phase 13 and Phase 14 but were not logged at the time. They live in the code (migrations `011`–`014`, `/admin`, `/review`, `/mastery`, `/upgrade`, `/pending`, `/blocked`).

## Phase 14 — Tracker Refinements (fact-check, edit, focus, coverage) ✅

Five refinements to the learning tracker. Two new concepts unify them: a per-milestone
**learning-points checklist** ("things to understand") and a per-track **persistent focus**.

### Decisions (agreed with Travis up front)
- Fact-check runs **automatically** on every entry save/edit; warning lingers until corrected.
- The understanding-**gap footnote is permanent** — kept even after the entry is corrected.
- The **focused milestone is remembered per track** (survives reload/navigation) — unifies the glow and the Ask goal.
- The activity check is **goal-grounded**: the milestone goal is broken into an enumerated checklist, and coverage is judged against it.
- Ask checklist cadence: recompute **on open + Refresh + Summarise** (not keystroke-live).

### Migrations
- `015_entry_factcheck.sql` — `milestone_entries`: `fact_status` (`pending`/`correct`/`incorrect`, with CHECK), `correction`, `gap_note`, `corrected`.
- `016_milestone_focus.sql` — `milestones`: `learning_points JSONB`, `coverage JSONB`; `tracks`: `focus_milestone_id UUID` FK.
- Patched `014_admin_system.sql` to `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before `CREATE POLICY` (idempotent re-runs). **Not re-run** — file-only per Travis.

### Types
- `Track.focus_milestone_id`; new `LearningPoint`, `MilestoneCoverage`; `Milestone.learning_points`/`coverage`; `FactStatus`; `MilestoneEntry.{fact_status,correction,gap_note,corrected}`.

### Prompts (`lib/claude/prompts.ts`)
- `factCheckEntryPrompt` — flags only genuine factual/conceptual errors (not reflections); returns `{status, correction, gap}`.
- `learningPointsPrompt` — 4–6 checkable "things to understand" from a milestone goal (generated lazily per card).
- `coveragePrompt` — judges which points the diary + chat meaningfully cover.

### API routes
- `POST /api/tracker/entries/[entryId]/verify` — auto fact-check; on `incorrect` persists correction + permanent gap and leaves the warning; on `correct` clears the warning but keeps the gap. Soft-fails (skips) if usage blocked.
- `PATCH /api/tracker/entries/[entryId]` — edit body/title (→ resets to `pending` for re-verify) or `action:"accept"` to apply the fix.
- `GET/POST /api/tracker/milestones/[id]/coverage` — GET ensures the checklist (one-time gen) + returns cached coverage; POST recomputes coverage from diary (+ optional `chatText`) and caches it.
- `PATCH /api/tracker/tracks/[trackId]` — set `focus_milestone_id`.
- All Claude calls wrapped with `logUsage` (`tracker/verify|points|coverage`).

### Components
- **MilestoneDrawer** — entry editing; clickable fact-check warning with **Accept fix** / **Rewrite myself**; permanent "Gap noted" footnote; new **"What to understand"** section with coverage ticks, `X of N covered` readiness, and a Re-check button. New entries auto-verify in the background; status icons (spinner/⚠/✓) per entry.
- **MilestoneCard / KanbanColumn / KanbanBoard** — new persistent `isFocused` glow sourced from `track.focus_milestone_id`; opening a card sets focus (PATCH track) and it stays glowing until another card is opened. Post-save `pulse` flash retained on top.
- **ChatWindow** — optional `onTranscriptChange` / `onSummariseStart` callbacks (non-breaking).
- **AskWorkspace** (new) — wraps ChatWindow + ChecklistRail, shares the transcript via a ref, triggers a rail recompute on Summarise.
- **ChecklistRail** (new) — persistent right-hand side-rail on Ask: enumerated checklist + live ticks; recomputes on open / Refresh / Summarise.
- **Ask page** — back arrow now goes to `/study/[goalId]/track`; focused milestone resolved from URL param **or** the track's persistent focus, so the goal stays in view.

**Pending deploy step:** run `015` and `016` in the Supabase SQL editor before this ships.

Zero TypeScript errors confirmed (`npx tsc --noEmit`, exit 0).

### Phase 14.1 — Embed ambiguity fix (live-testing bug)
The Ask checklist showed "unavailable". Root cause: `016`'s new `tracks.focus_milestone_id → milestones` FK created a **second** relationship between `milestones` and `tracks`, so PostgREST could no longer resolve `tracks!inner(...)` embeds — they errored with *"more than one relationship was found"*. This silently broke five routes (coverage + verify, plus the pre-existing **milestones PATCH**, **mastery session**, and **review quiz** ownership checks). Fixed by disambiguating with the FK-column hint: `tracks!track_id!inner(...)` in all five. `learning_points` was correctly null (lazy-gen) — the lazy-gen just never ran because the ownership query 404'd first. Verified against the live DB via service-role query.

### Phase 14.2 — Embed ambiguity, round 2 (the `.tsx` + reverse-direction misses)
The 14.1 grep was scoped to `**/*.ts`, so it missed **page** components (`.tsx`) and reverse-direction embeds. Three more spots had the same `016` ambiguity:
- `app/review/[milestoneId]/page.tsx` and `app/mastery/[milestoneId]/page.tsx` — `tracks!inner(user_id)`; the failing query made `milestone` null → `notFound()`/redirect, surfacing as a **genuine 404 page** when opening a review quiz or mastery session. Fixed with `tracks!track_id!inner(...)`.
- `app/tracker/page.tsx` — the **reverse** embed `tracks` → `milestones(...)` (the dashboard's milestone counts) was also ambiguous. Fixed with `milestones!track_id(...)`.
Swept every file extension afterwards; no embeds remain unqualified. Verified the original 404'd milestone ID now resolves. `tsc` exit 0.

## Phase 15 — Backlog Priority ✅

A study-order guide for the Backlog column so a novice knows what to tackle next.

### Decisions (clarified with Travis)
- Priority **is** the build-time curriculum order Hugh already generates (fundamentals → advanced, stored as `position`). **No AI call, no re-ranking** — the ranks are fixed at track creation and never change; they're the learner's guide.
- Per-track **Auto | Manual** toggle (default Auto). Auto shows the fixed ranks; Manual lets the learner reorder.
- Manual mechanic: **up/down arrows**, not drag — an agentic call to avoid destabilising the working cross-column DnD right before a push (no `@dnd-kit/sortable`, no board refactor). Drag-sort noted as a clean fast-follow.

### Migration
- `017_backlog_priority.sql` — `tracks.backlog_priority_mode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'auto'` + CHECK (`auto`|`manual`). **Must be run before this ships.** Degrades gracefully to `auto` if unapplied (column read as undefined → default).

### Types / API
- `Track.backlog_priority_mode`; `BacklogPriorityMode` type.
- `PATCH /api/tracker/tracks/[trackId]` extended to accept `backlogPriorityMode`.
- `PATCH /api/tracker/tracks/[trackId]/reorder` — persists a manual backlog order by reassigning the *existing set* of `position` values to the new order (keeps cards interleaved correctly vs. other columns; no global renumber).

### Components
- **MilestoneCard** — sky `#n` rank badge (backlog only); up/down arrows in Manual mode with `stopPropagation` so they don't trigger drag/drawer.
- **KanbanColumn** — compact Auto|Manual segmented toggle in the Backlog header; passes rank + move handlers to cards.
- **KanbanBoard** — `priorityMode` state, `toggleMode` (persists), `moveCard` (optimistic position swap + reorder PATCH with revert); `byColumn` now sorts by `position` so reorders render.
- Both track pages pass `backlogPriorityMode`.

Zero TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`, exit 0).

### Phase 15.1 — Agentic backlog priority (replaces deterministic order)
The Phase 15 rank was just the build-order `position`. Replaced with a **one-time agentic ranking** computed at generation.

- **Migration `018_priority_rank.sql`** — `milestones.priority_rank INTEGER`, `priority_reason TEXT`. **Run before shipping.**
- `backlogPriorityPrompt` + `lib/tracker/priority.ts` `assignBacklogPriority(supabase, trackId, topic)` — one Claude call reasons through the backlog's dependencies and returns a build order; writes each card's rank + a one-line reason. Deliberately **no `server-only` import** (reusable by the backfill); returns token usage for the caller to log.
- `generateTrack` calls it once after inserting milestones, logs usage as `tracker/priority`, non-blocking on failure. **No recompute triggers anywhere** — set once, stays fixed as cards move/are added. (Confirmed there was never a `/rank` route to drop.)
- **UI:** Auto mode orders the backlog by `priority_rank` and shows a sky `#n` badge with the reason as a hover tooltip — pure guidance, doesn't restrict opening. Manual mode hides the badge/order entirely (backlog in the learner's own order) and keeps the up/down arrows for self-sequencing (unchanged). `byColumn` sorts backlog by `priority_rank` in auto, by `position` otherwise; null ranks (pre-existing tracks) fall back to position with no badge.
- **Existing tracks:** `scripts/backfill-priority.mjs` (run once, after `018`) ranks any track whose backlog isn't yet ranked; idempotent; safe to delete after.

Zero TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`, exit 0).

### Phase 16 — STEP 1: Decouple track generation from POST /api/dashboard/goals
Goal creation no longer blocks on track generation. The goals route inserts the
`learning_goals` row as `track_status='pending'` and returns immediately;
`generateTrack` (milestones + backlog priority) runs after the response.

- **Migration `019_goal_track_status.sql`** — `learning_goals.track_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ready'` + CHECK (`pending`|`ready`|`failed`); `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`; adds the table to the `supabase_realtime` publication (guarded, idempotent). Existing rows default `ready`. **Must be run before this ships.**
- `app/api/dashboard/goals/route.ts` — returns as soon as `refineTopicPrompt` resolves + the goal row is inserted. `generateTrack` moved into `after()` (next/server) using a **service-role** client (cookie-bound request client isn't guaranteed valid post-response); its try/catch flips the row to `ready`/`failed`. `export const maxDuration = 60`.
- `RefinementFlow.tsx` — removed the fixed STAGES / 2.4s ticker. Waiting phase now subscribes to Supabase Realtime on the goal row (`postgres_changes` UPDATE, filtered by id), with a post-`SUBSCRIBED` status fetch as a race guard and a single-`settle` ref. New **failed** phase ("we couldn't build your track — goal is saved") instead of silently landing on an empty track.
- `GoalCard.tsx` — renders `pending` (spinner + "Building your track…", Start disabled) and `failed` (red badge, Start disabled) so a reload mid-build / a failed goal is never a silent dead end.
- `types/index.ts` — `TrackStatus`; `LearningGoal.track_status`.
- `globals.css` — `progress-slide` indeterminate shimmer (replaces the fake staged progress).

Static verification green: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `next build` all clean.
Live verification (create → fast response → populate → forced-failure shows `failed`) deferred to Travis — requires migration 019 applied + a real auth session.

> ⚠️ **DEPLOY-TARGET RISK (Hobby plan):** `after()` runs inside the same serverless
> invocation and is bound by the function timeout. Hobby caps at **10s regardless of
> `maxDuration`**, and `generateTrack` chains two Claude calls (milestones ~2k tokens +
> backlog priority) that routinely exceed 10s. On Hobby, `after()` will be killed
> mid-build → goals stuck `pending` or wrongly marked `failed`. **The `after()` approach
> is a stopgap; track-gen needs a real background job (Supabase Edge Function trigger /
> DB-trigger queue) before this is reliable in production.** The status column + Realtime
> + failed-state UI built here are reusable by that job unchanged.

### Phase 16 — STEP 2: Harden refine-phase error handling
The refinement asking phase could hang permanently: a 502 from `/api/dashboard/refine`
does **not** throw client-side, so the old `try/catch` never fired — `res.json()`
returned `{error}`, `data.done` was falsy, and `setQuestion(null)` left the UI stuck on a
disabled "Hugh is thinking…" state forever.

- `app/api/dashboard/refine/route.ts` — the Claude call + JSON parse now retry **once**
  before returning 502 (covers transient API/parse failures).
- `RefinementFlow.tsx` — new `tryRefine()` helper retries the request once and treats
  `!res.ok` **and** malformed payloads (neither `question` nor `done`) as failures, not
  just thrown network errors. On exhausted failure the flow **cannot stall**:
  - mid-refinement (≥1 answer): advance straight to the Waiting/build phase rather than
    looping on a broken endpoint;
  - first question (0 answers): show a generic prompt so the learner can still engage —
    answering it advances toward the MAX_QUESTIONS cap, which terminates into Waiting.

Verified live (dev server, auth-bypass): happy path → 200 + question; no auth → 401;
forced Claude failure (invalid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) → **clean 502 in ~1.1s, no hang**.
Client "reaches Waiting rather than hanging" path verified by code/types + the confirmed
clean 502 (full browser-driven run needs a real auth session, same constraint as STEP 1).
`tsc`, `eslint`, `next build` all clean.

### Phase 16 — STEP 1 fix: "Building…" hang (found in live test)
Travis's localhost test: after submitting the refinement, the UI stuck on
"Building your learning track…". DB check showed the goal reached
`track_status='ready'` — so `after()`/`generateTrack` worked; the bug was purely
frontend: **Supabase Realtime never delivered the UPDATE** (the classic silent
drop on RLS-protected tables when the socket isn't authed), and the single
race-guard fetch had run instantly while still `pending`.

Fix in `RefinementFlow.tsx`: Realtime is now only the fast path. Added (a) a 3s
**poll** of `track_status` via the authed browser client — the reliable path that
doesn't depend on Realtime; (b) `realtime.setAuth(session.access_token)` so the
socket can actually receive RLS changes; (c) a **180s hard timeout** that surfaces
the failed state instead of hanging — which also covers the Vercel Hobby case
where the background build is killed and the row stays `pending` forever
([[after-hobby-limitation]]). All transitions funnel through the single-`settle`
guard; `cleanup` clears poll + timeout + channel.

### Phase 16 — STEP 1 hardening: stalled-goal safety
Closes the one residual dead-end before the Hobby test deploy. If a background
build is killed past `maxDuration` (or the tab closes before the client
watchdog), the goal row stays `pending` forever and a reload showed an endless
"Building…" spinner. `GoalCard` now treats a goal `pending` for more than
`STALL_MS` (5 min — safely beyond the 120s server cap) as **stalled**: red
warning, "Track build stalled — remove and re-add", disabled Start. Read-only
(no DB writes), so it also covers the closed-tab case. Computed client-side via a
`setTimeout` (delay clamped to 0) to avoid an SSR/CSR hydration mismatch and the
react-hooks "synchronous setState in effect" rule.

Context: Vercel Hobby + Fluid Compute allows up to 300s (verified against docs
2026-06-19), so `after()` track-gen is viable on Hobby; `maxDuration=120`.
Fluid Compute + env vars confirmed enabled by Travis. [[after-hobby-limitation]]

### Phase 17 — Mastery redo (practice) + learning summary document
Two-part refinement on the Mastery feature.

**Redo for practice (no bucket move):**
- A "Practice again" button on a Mastered card re-runs the voice session in place
  (the `/mastery/[id]` route already requires the `done` column, so nothing moves).
- `MasteryClient` gains an `alreadyMastered` mode: the result screen always frames
  as "Still mastered", offers "Save score & finish" + "Practice again", and the
  setup copy reflects a practice run. Score rule = **latest**: a practice finish
  PATCHes `mastery_score` (+ feedback) to the most recent run even if lower, and
  **never** sends `mastery_validated:false` — mastery is never revoked.

**Learning summary document (AI narrative, in-app + downloadable):**
- `migration 020_milestone_summary.sql` — `milestones.mastery_feedback`,
  `summary_doc`, `summary_doc_at`. **Must be applied before this ships.**
- `masterySummaryPrompt` (markdown out) builds a "what you learned" doc from the
  milestone, the checklist + coverage, the diary entries (incl. gap notes), and
  the latest mastery score/feedback.
- `POST /api/tracker/milestones/[id]/summary` — ownership + must-be-`done` →
  generate → store `summary_doc`/`summary_doc_at` → return. Logs `tracker/summary`.
- Auto-generated on first mastery (`MasteryClient.confirmMastery` also persists
  `mastery_feedback` then fires the summary POST, non-fatal). Practice runs do NOT
  auto-regenerate (on-demand only).
- `MilestoneDrawer` (mastered cards): renders the doc via `react-markdown` +
  `remark-gfm`, with **Regenerate** and **Download** (`.md` Blob) actions, or a
  "Generate summary" button when none exists yet. Reads the doc off the milestone
  (`select("*")`), keeps local state for regeneration.

Verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `next build` compiles. (Pre-existing eslint
warnings in untouched lines unchanged.) Live test pending Travis after applying
migration 020 — redo keeps mastery + updates score; summary auto-generates,
renders, downloads, regenerates. PDF export deferred to v2 (markdown only).

### Phase 17.1 — Summary generation moved to background (drawer-driven)
Per UX feedback: confirming mastery no longer waits on the summary. `confirmMastery`
now only validates + navigates (fast). The `MilestoneDrawer` auto-generates the
summary the first time a mastered card is opened without one — showing the existing
"Hugh is writing your summary…" state — via an effect keyed on the milestone id that
reads the milestone prop and defers the call with `setTimeout(0)` (keeps it out of
the effect body). Manual Regenerate/Download unchanged.

### Phase 18 — "What to understand" becomes a manual self-check
The AI coverage assessment was unreliable (it credited points that *Hugh* explained
in chat, not what the learner engaged with — even after the prompt fix it conflated
teaching with understanding). Coverage is now a manual self-assessment the learner
controls. AI still *generates* the checklist items (`learningPointsPrompt`); only
the determination of what's covered changed.

- `POST /api/tracker/milestones/[id]/coverage` — no longer calls Claude. Accepts
  `{ coveredIds }`, validates against the milestone's checklist, and persists into
  the existing `coverage.coveredIds` (no migration; existing marks kept). GET
  unchanged (still generates the checklist items once if missing).
- `coveragePrompt` removed from `lib/claude/prompts.ts` (dead).
- `ChecklistRail` (Ask side-rail) — each item is now a toggle that persists
  optimistically; removed the AI Refresh + chat-transcript wiring. Footer guides:
  "Tick each idea once you're confident you understand it."
- `AskWorkspace` — dropped the transcript ref + summarise-recompute plumbing.
- `MilestoneDrawer` — checklist items toggle on click; "Re-check" replaced with the
  same guidance; a dismissible amber **nudge** appears before starting Review /
  Mastery when items are still unticked ("you still have N unticked… you can carry
  on"). Never blocks (per decision: guidance + gentle nudge; existing marks kept).

tsc + next build clean. No migration. (Pre-existing eslint warnings unchanged.)

### Phase 19 — Token-cost optimization (Claude spend) ✅
Input tokens are ~83% of Claude spend, so all work is input-side.

**learn/chat prompt caching:** ephemeral cache breakpoint so the system prompt +
conversation prefix is reused across turns (cache reads ~0.1x). `tokensIn` now
counts `input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens`; cache reads excluded so a
warm cache eases the learner's quota. learn/chat was ~45% of spend.

**Monthly usage gauge:** `getUsageSummary()` + `<HeaderUsage />` temperature bar
(sky→amber→red) next to the username on all 7 page headers. Reuses the same
profiles columns + usage_logs window as `checkUsageAllowed` — no migration.

**Model selection (CLAUDE.md mandate relaxed):** Sonnet for reasoning-heavy,
Haiku for classification/short-gen. Moved to `claude-haiku-4-5` (5x cheaper
input): check-similarity, generate-hint, dashboard/refine (5-whys), mastery
open/respond. Mastery evaluate (scoring), quiz gen, fact-check, learn/summarize,
track gen, and interview feedback stay on Sonnet.

**Cap diary input:** mastery/session + review/quiz slice each entry body at 2000
chars (mirrors factCheck), bounding worst-case input tokens.

**Merge interview submit:** `submitAnswerPrompt` folds the alignment judgment into
generate-feedback — one Sonnet call returns {usedBestAnswer, alignmentScore,
feedback}, halving calls + duplicated context. useInterview drops
apiCheckSimilarity; usedBestAnswer persisted server-side. State machine unchanged.

tsc --noEmit clean; next build compiles (exit 0). No migration.
